_taskwarrior export scripts, as found at the bottom of http://taskwarrior.org/tools/_

This repo is for the development, and ideally replacement, of these legacy taskwarrior add-ons that represent considerable "out-of-the-box functionality. Because these scripts have languished under /usr/local/share/doc/task/addons/ for years, with little fanfare or contributions, they have been almost forgotten. IMHO the scripts themselves should be reimplemented, harnessing the current (task v.2.4.5) import and export capabilities.
